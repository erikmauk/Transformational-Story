Computational Art: Project 4 (Tadpole Transformation Story)

In this project, I worked with two partners: Victoria Rund (she's a reocurring theme in my projects since we worked well together)
and Kaylee Kitayama.

Basically, we made three distinct sprites that tell the story of a tadpole, turning into a frog that subsequently eats a frog.
Again, vectors were used to track the location and speed of the tadpole and of the frog's toungue. 
Hierarchical modeling was used to make the fly flap its wings in place. 
Also, a particle system, which is used in my Fireworks lab (lab 9) fills the swampy scene with some rain.

Within this repository, you will find a demo video of the final product attached. Enjoy!
